Replica of the booking website

I created application based on the booking page with basic features. At the page you can choose location's type, city or just type location in the searching bar (starting with the capital letter f.e. Zakopane). Then application shows the list of places with chosen filters. After choosing place you can go to page with hotel details.

My project is fully-responsive (I noticed problems with sliders, but I tested them and I think it's problem with react-slider). I also used some hooks: useState, useContext, useRef, useEffect.

Also I want to notice, that I didn't use any programs to steal/copy the original code. I created structure, logic and code by myself.
