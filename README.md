Replica of the booking website

I created application based on booking page with basic features. At the page you can choose object category, city or just type location at searching bar (start with big letter f.e. Zakopane). Then application shows the list of places with proper filters. After choosing place you can go to page with hotel details.

My project is fully-responsive (I noticed problems with sliders, but I tested them and I think it's problem with react-slider). 

Also I want to notice, that I hadn't use any programs to steal/copy the original code. I created structure, logic and code by myself.
